# NoSQL_Challenge

This challenge was made possible with the help of classmate Andrew as well as ChatGPT and classroom activities.

The biggest challenge for this assignment was haveing the MongoDB needing to be reset everytime I had to go back in my code. That was very frustrating, but eventually I got the hang of it.

Here is a snapshot of my MongoDB after the data was imported
